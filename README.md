Hello everyone, Happy New Year!

Recently, I've noticed some issues on certain domestic community platforms in China, such as KuAn and QiMiao, where some users are promoting projects in violation of the platform rules by sharing links or images related to the projects.

This has made me concerned because I have clearly expressed my worries about such risks. I'm different from those who openly charge fees for QQ updates in China; I don't want to attract that kind of attention.

I want to emphasize that the project has always been free, and I don't intend to profit from it or seek sponsorship for it.

You may think I'm being hypocritical, but I feel compelled to address these violations of project rules to avoid potential risks, especially during the Spring Festival.

The project has now been removed from Releases to mitigate these risks.
